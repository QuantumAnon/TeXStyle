# TeXStyle

This is a LaTeX style that I use for most of the documents I write. While this mostly consists of several packages that I've often used brought together into one, there are some slight modifications to make them work well together/look acceptable.

## Information

TeXStyle can be installed in a number of ways, see the [install guide](./docs/install.md) for more information.

The documentation for TeXStyle is generated using TeX's `docstrip` utility.
The [documentation guide](./docs/documentation.md) contains information on where to find this.
