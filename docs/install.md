# Using TeXStyle

To use the TeXStyle package you can either:

+ [Download and install a precompiled version](#installing-precompiled-versions-of-texstyle) (recommended)
+ [Download the source and compile it yourself](#compiling-from-source)

The guide given here is a general method that outlines the necessary steps needed but doesn't take into account the differences across platforms.
Platform specific changes are listed [here](link plox).
It might be useful to give that a read before continuing so you know what will work for your platform.

## Installing Precompiled Versions of TeXStyle

This method is recommended for those that are either new to TeX or simply want something that works.
Go to the [builds](link plox) folder and download the zip for the version you want.
This should contain:

+ TeXStyle.sty
+ TeXStyle-article.cls
+ TeXStyle-Documentation.pdf

If you just want the style and nothing else copy
